# Solution 1

So, I deleted all instances of the esp-idf, and any other esp-idf offering, to start from scratch with vscode. &#x20;

To wit, it tweren't me.  Very happy I get the same error when using the vscode esp-idf wizard.  Note also, the tick box "Show all ESP-IDF tags".  That was necessary as the "Select ESP-IDF version:" drop down was limited to V5.x otherwise.

But of course, the problem with the venv breakage also manifests when installing esp-idf v4.0 this way.
