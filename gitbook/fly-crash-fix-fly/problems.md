# Problems

There is a priori knowledge requirement that is vast here.  Much of the "help" assumes you are probably living and breathing esp-idf.  So, I need take this slow.

There are certainly enough errors being thrown up so as to crush a lesser person.

To wit, I am feeling crushed :cry:.

And yet, I persist.

Outside of the problems with dependencies, I found once I started with the handbuilt 4.0 I was seeing an error when the install.sh runs:

```log
/home/asterion/esp/v4.0/esp-idf/tools/idf_tools.py
```
